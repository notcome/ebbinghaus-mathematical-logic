# Mathematical Logic

This repository is about my reading notes of _Mathematical Logic_ by Ebbinghaus/Flum/Thomas. I had finished the first four chapters by the mid of summer 2015, but found myself unable to move any further, i.e. the Completeness Theorem.

In fall 2015, the first quarter of my college life, I took one symbolic logic course and a so-called “proof-based” linear algebra. I decided to attack this little yellow book again. This time, I will take notes and do most exercises seriously. My reading is powered by Typora, the markdown editor for the future generation.
